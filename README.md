Bootswitch
==========

Bootswatch is a collection of free themes for [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/). Check it out at [bootswitch](http://mosama.me/bootswitch/).

Usage
-----
Download the `bootstrap.min.css` file associated with a theme and replace Bootstrap's default stylesheet.

The themes are also hosted on [BootstrapCDN](http://www.bootstrapcdn.com/bootswatch/).

 Rails users should check out:

* [twitter-bootswatch-rails](https://github.com/scottvrosenthal/twitter-bootswatch-rails) if using _LESS_.
* [bootswatch-rails](https://github.com/maxim/bootswatch-rails) if using _SASS_.


Customization
------
Bootswitch is open source and youâ€™re welcome to modify the themes.

Each theme consists of two LESS files. `variables.less`, which is included by default in Bootstrap, allows you to customize [these settings](http://getbootstrap.com/customize/#less-variables). `bootswatch.less` introduces more extensive structural changes.

These files are also available in SASS.

Check out the [Help page](http://bootswatch.com/help/) for more details on building your own theme.
